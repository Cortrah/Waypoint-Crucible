Interesting Thoughts

While working on this I keep on finding that state that I think belongs at the leaves,
keeps bubbling up. An example, in crucible.helm.playerconsole.simplecard
the state that seems logical is that the card shows whether it's selected or not and displays it
via a style, when one simplecard is selected, the event bubbles to the playerconsole which
deselects all it's cards and then selects the current card so there is only one ever currently
selected.

But because PlayerConsole is getting its state from game and just passing it through,
it doesn't have the rights to change the props, nor does helm, so I have to add this
all the way up at crucible. However this works because Crucible is already setting the
actual card index.

I guess the question going forward is how much responsibility is eventually going to be
so centralized. Stay tuned.

So in that last pass isSel moved from data to a prop, but now instead of using it as a prop
I can pass it's index in as a prop and the selectedCardIndex as a prop
and determine whether it selected with a computed property so I don't need to change crucible
after all.

so what do I default selectedCardIndex and myIndex to? null? -1? Zakas says not to use null
but it seems to make sense here
